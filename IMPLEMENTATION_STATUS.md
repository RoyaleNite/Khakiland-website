## 📝 IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Stock Management Logic
- **Paid instantly** → Stock deducted immediately
- **Order cancelled (not shipped)** → Stock restored immediately
- **Order cancelled (already shipped)** → Use "received back" to restore stock
- **One-time items** → Hidden when stock = 0
- **Restockable items** → Show "Out of Stock" when stock = 0

### User Roles
- **Regular Users**: Profile, orders, addresses, shopping
- **Staff Users**: Everything + dashboard, order management, inventory management

### Payment Flow
- Checkout includes payment method selection
- Payment status: unpaid/paid/refunded
- Payment methods: cash, card, bank_transfer, eft, in_store
